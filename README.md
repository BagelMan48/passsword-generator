# password-generator
My very first project! I wanted to make something that I could use in the future, and a password generator felt perfect for me.<br/>
It was very fun. It was also my first time attempting to play around with the files and JSON, which was admittedly a little frustrating but I'm glad I was able to figure it out in the end (with some help).




## Features
- Custom-length passwords
- Optional special character inclusion
- Storing passwords
- Replacing passwords

## Example procedure
Entering the length of your password<br/>

Example randomized passwords. One with and one without special characters.</br>

If you want to save your password, you can do so and label what password it's for. Otherwise, the file will close.</br>

It is saved!</br>

If a password for github already exists, it will ask to replace it.</br>

The password for github has been replaced!</br>

I plan to improve this again in the near future! :D
