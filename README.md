# password-generator
My very first project! I wanted to make something that I could use in the future, and a password generator felt perfect for me.<br/>
It was very fun. It was also my first time attempting to play around with the files, JSON, and SQLite which was admittedly a little frustrating but I'm glad I was able to figure it out in the end (with some help).</br>



## Features
- Custom-length passwords
- Optional special character inclusion
- Storing and viewing passwords in either JSON or DB
- Replacing passwords
- Encrypting passwords

## Example procedure
The option to choose between viewing or generating a password. In this case, I will generate one</br>

Entering the length of your password and choosing to include special characters or not. In this case, I chose special characters with a length of 10.<br/>

If you want to save your password, you can do so and label what password it's for. Otherwise, the program will close.</br>

Finally, it will ask you if you want to encrypt the password. Once you do that, congrats! You have created your password!!</br>

Here you can view the list of passwords, access an individual one, and decrypt/encrypt if you wish to.</br>

And finally here is me successfully replacing the Github password.</br>
